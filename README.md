## IntelliJ
 - You can quickly find all places where a particular class, method or variable is used in the whole project by positioning the caret at the symbol's name or at its usage in code and pressing ⌥F7 (Edit | Find | Find Usages in the popup menu).
 
 - To quickly see the documentation for a class or method at caret, press F1 (View | Quick Documentation).
 
 - To navigate to the declaration of a class, method or variable used somewhere in the code, position the caret at the usage and press ⌘B (Navigate | Declaration). You can also click the mouse on usages with the Ctrl key pressed to jump to declarations.
 
 - You can quickly navigate in the currently edited file with ⌘F12 (Navigate | File Structure). It shows the list of members of the current class. Select an element you want to navigate to and press the Enter key or the ⌘↓ key.  To easily locate an item in the list, just start typing its name.
 
 - You may easily override methods of the base class by pressing ⌃O (Code | Override Methods).  To implement methods of the interfaces that the current class implements (or of the abstract base class), use ⌃I (Code | Implement methods).
